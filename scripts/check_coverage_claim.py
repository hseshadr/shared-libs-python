"""Fail the gate when the README's published coverage figures drift from reality.

The README states two specific numbers. Numbers in prose rot silently: the suite
grows, the real figure moves, and the doc keeps advertising the old one. This
script re-derives both figures from the `coverage.xml` that the test run just
wrote and compares them to what the README claims.

It runs as a gate step *after* `pytest`, not as a test, because pytest writes
`coverage.xml` at session end — a test reading that file mid-session would only
ever see the previous run's numbers, and would find no file at all on a fresh
checkout.

Usage: ``python scripts/check_coverage_claim.py``

"""A released changelog section is immutable: `vX.Y.Z` must reproduce `X.Y.Z`.

This repository's whole thesis is provable provenance, so a rewritten release
record is precisely the failure it claims to prevent. The `[0.2.0]` section was
once edited in place *after* tagging — the header moved from `2026-07-14` to
`2026-07-20` and gained 23 lines describing post-tag work — which meant checking
out `v0.2.0` did not reproduce what `HEAD` called `0.2.0`.

This test compares every released (non-`Unreleased`) section at `HEAD` against
the same section as it stood at its own tag, and fails on any difference. New
work belongs under `[Unreleased]`; a shipped section is history.

Link-reference lines (`[0.2.0]: https://…/compare/…`) are excluded: that footer
is a growing index of every release, not part of any one release's record.

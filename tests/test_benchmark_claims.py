"""The published benchmark figures must stay tethered to a real measurement.

The docs once published a best-of-many point estimate that a fresh run did not
reproduce: every figure was optimistic, and across six runs none landed on the
claim. This guards the figures without becoming flaky.

**What this test asserts — and deliberately does not.** It never runs the
benchmark. Timing a workload inside a test suite makes the suite fail on a busy
CI box, which teaches people to ignore it. Instead *both sides are committed
constants*: `REFERENCE` below records what was actually measured (2026-07-20,
Apple M3 Pro, macOS 26.5 arm64, CPython 3.13.5, 20 samples, idle machine), and
the docs carry the figures a reader sees. The test asserts they agree within a
3x band, that no published figure exceeds the benchmark's own budget, and that
README and OPERATIONS publish identical numbers.

A 3x band cannot fail on machine variance — nothing is timed here — but it does
catch the real drift: a doc edited to claim an order-of-magnitude better number,
a figure copied to one doc and not the other, or a budget tightened past the
measurement it is supposed to cover. Re-measure and update `REFERENCE` in the
same change whenever the published figures move.
